# CS-350-Emerging-Systems-Architectures-Technologies


# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project I chose to showcase for this class is the first milestone. For this project, we were tasked with creating blinking lights on our TI board through the use of PWM.

# What did you do particularly well?
I was successful in completing this project and did well with understanding the different components of the source code, as well as how best to modify the code to match the project requirements. 

# Where could you improve?
While my project was successful, there is always room for improvement. I would like to explore other methods, perhaps more concise, that achieve the correct result as well.

# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Some resources I am adding to my support network include zyBooks, different microcontroller boards, and different IDE's for controlling those boards. It's important to be well versed in different technologies and platforms, and gain as much experience as you can. zyBooks is also a great resource to learn by doing. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
For this project, I learned how to use a microcontroller, how to use Code Composer Studio, as well as how embedded systems function and how to control them and tailor them to specific needs. These are great skills to take with me for use in both my personal and professional life. 

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project was made maintainable, readable, and adaptable, through use of pre-constructed code and clear comments throughout the code to mark and explain any changes.
